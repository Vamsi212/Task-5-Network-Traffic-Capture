# üõ°Ô∏è Task 5 - Network Traffic Capture & Protocol Analysis (Wireshark)

## üìå Objective
Capture live network packets using Wireshark and identify basic network protocols in the traffic.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: Network protocol analyzer for capturing and analyzing packets.
- **Operating System**: Windows 11

---

## üì¶ Steps Performed

1. **Installed Wireshark** from [https://www.wireshark.org/](https://www.wireshark.org/).
2. **Started a live capture** on the active interface (`Wi-Fi`/`Ethernet`).
3. **Generated traffic** by:
   - Browsing websites (e.g., `example.com`)
   - Accessing local network services
4. **Stopped the capture** after approximately 1 minute.
5. **Applied filters** in Wireshark to analyze protocols.
6. **Identified and noted down** multiple distinct protocols.
7. **Exported the capture** as a `.pcap` file.
8. **Compiled this short report.**

## üîç Protocols Identified

| Protocol     | Description                                         | Notes / Packet Example                            |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **TCP**      | Transmission Control Protocol                      | Reliable, connection-based communication          |
| **UDP**      | User Datagram Protocol                              | Lightweight, connectionless communication         |
| **HTTP**     | HyperText Transfer Protocol                         | Web traffic, GET/POST requests                    |
| **DNS**      | Domain Name System                                  | Resolving domain names to IP addresses            |
| **TLSv1.2**  | Transport Layer Security v1.2                       | Encrypted HTTPS traffic                           |
| **QUIC**     | UDP-based protocol for faster web traffic (used by Google) | Observed in modern browser traffic         |
| **mDNS**     | Multicast DNS                                       | Local name resolution without a central DNS       |
| **SSDP**     | Simple Service Discovery Protocol                   | Used in UPnP for device discovery                 |
| **ARP**      | Address Resolution Protocol                         | Resolves MAC addresses from IP addresses          |
| **DHCPv6**   | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6       | Assigns IPv6 addresses dynamically                |
